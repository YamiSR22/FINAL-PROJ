# Final Project Week README #
## Overview ##

You are working as a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.

You will start by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts are working, after which you will monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
